# CENTER OF MASS VISUALISATION
This is a program written to increase my physics grade during my second semester of college. The content of the task can be found in the "task" folder.


## INSTRUCTION
◼️ If you want open up init_data.txt folder and change data according to rules.

◼️ If you want to add particle then add necessary data in masses, forces and initial positions.

◼️ Turn on executable file.

◼️ Watch visualisation.

◼️ Open up output. You can see there final coordinates of the particles and center of mass.

## MATH AND PHYSICS BEHIND IT
Newton's 2nd law of motion:
F = ma
a = (d^2)x/dt^2
F = m * (d^2)x/dt^2
(d^2)x/dt^2 = F/m -> Dynamic equation of motion
I used this second order differential equation to track particles and than visualise center of the mass.
