60. Three particles with masses
m1 = 4 kg, 
m2 = 8 kg,
m3 = 4 kg are placed on the XOY plane. 

At time t = 0, these particles are at rest, 
and their positions are respectively: 
(-2.2) m, 
(4.1) m,
(-3.0) m. 

Forces
F1(vector) = -F1x̂, F1 = 16 N; 
F2(vector) = F2ŷ, F2 = 16N; 
F3(vector) = F3x̂, F3 = 8 N 
acts on each of these bodies.
 
Find the position of the center of mass at time t = 2 s.
